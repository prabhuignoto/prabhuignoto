# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Prabhu Murthy and I am a software developer with a passion for creating elegant and intuitive user interfaces. I have built and maintained several popular open-source projects, including:

- **[react-chrono](https://github.com/prabhuignoto/react-chrono)** - Dynamic and interactive timelines in your applications
- **[vue-float-menu](https://github.com/prabhuignoto/vue-float-menu)** - Floating, context-sensitive menus in your applications
- **[vue-dock-menu](https://github.com/prabhuignoto/vue-dock-menu)** - Dockable menus in your applications, enabling users to access frequently used features and tools with ease
- **[react-visual-grid](https://github.com/prabhuignoto/react-visual-grid)** - Designed for displaying images in a visually appealing grid or masonry format

## Building react-creme

I am currently working on a brand new UI toolkit for React called [react-creme](https://github.com/prabhuignoto/react-creme/). This project represents a departure from my previous work in that it is specifically designed to be a comprehensive and fully-featured UI toolkit, providing developers with a wide range of pre-built UI components and design patterns to help them build beautiful and functional applications with ease.

## Freelance Tech Blogger

In addition to my work on react-creme, I am also a freelance tech blogger. I enjoy writing about the latest trends and developments in the world of software development, and sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.
